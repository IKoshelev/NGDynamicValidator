        Lets say you need to validate an input only on <code>blur</code>, but once
        that results invalid you want to give your user feedback on validity as soon,
        as he corrects the input, without waiting for 'blur' to happen again. Make that
        a click of a "save" button and resulting <code>$beforeSave</code> event instead of blur,
        and it is definitely a good idea to mark each field as valid as soon as it is corrected.
        Not to mention, that you can disable the "save" button untill <code>$beforeSave</code> event
        is valid for each input again.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>_excludedNonValids</code> allows you to do jsut that by changing the behaviour of events that resulted
        in invalid the last time they were validating, but would not noramlly participate in the current valiation.
        The first input of this example showcases a typical case - maxLength(5) will be validated on <code>blur</code>
        and if it result in invalid, it will validate on each symbol entered, untill length of the input becomes 5 or less, 
        at which point it will instantly become valid and won't trigger again untill next blur.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall avaliable options are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>"validate"</code> - the default behvaiour described above
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>"setValid"</code> - all events that do not participate in a triggered validation will 
                be set valid. Seccond input in the example showcases this. If you enter 7 symbols into it, 
                blur it and then enter another - blur event will instantly become valid. It will reevaluate on next actual 
                blur event as a part of normal workflow.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code> "doNothing"</code> - validation is only triggered for events that participate, others are left
                valid or invalid as is, without recheck.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        This behaviour applies to any validation, no matter what actually triggered it - be it the <code>default</code> event,
        a JS event or VALIDATION_REQUEST angular event.
