        NGDynamicValidtor is applied to a directive like this.
        <br />
        <code>
            &lt;input ng-model="name" ng-dynamic-validator="options" /&gt;
        </code>
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Options object can be defined in you controller and passed via scope,
        or you can create a json object string inline in HTML as value ot the ng-dynamic-validator attribute.
        If you choose the inline path - your string will be parsed via <code>$parse</code> Angular service
        against the $scope of the directive and <code>validators</code> service, allowing you to reference
        properties from both of them (<code>validators</code> service contains standard validtor function 
        like maxLength and required, it is described later). This example demostrates both approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
        Keys on the options object are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>_validateRequestGroups</code> - array of strings. Used to specificaly target VALIDATION_REQUEST angular events
                at a certain group of inputs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>_validateTogetherGroups</code> - array of strings. Elements that belong to a group
                will trigger validation of that group when they validate - every input in the group will also validate
                (events being validated are the same that triggered validation on the original input).
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>_validateTogetherGroupsBehaviour</code> - string describing desired behaviour. To avoid misspells, there is an injectable angular constant
                <pre><code>
NGDynamicValdiatorModule.constant("excludedNonValidsBehaviours", {
    //triggers but does not validate with the group
    onlyTrigger: "onlyTrigger",
    //triggers once per group validation <strong>(default)</strong>
    afterFirst: "afterFirst",
    //will validate after each input in the gruop 
    afterEach: "afterEach"      
};
                </code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>_excludedNonValids</code> - string describing desired behaviour. Behaviour of the valitdors for events that resulted
                invalid during the last time they validated.
                <pre><code>
NGDynamicValdiatorModule.constant("excludedNonValidsBehaviours",{
    //Once an event like blur has resulted in invalid, 
    //it will validated on every ocasion, 
    //untill resulting valid again <strong>(default)</strong>
    validate: "validate",
    //Do nothing - if such an event is not participating 
    //in a triggered validation - it will not trigger
    doNothing: "doNothing",
    //Once invalid, the event will be set valid again on the 
    //next validation in which it does not participate
    setValid: "setValid"   
};
                </code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>eventName</code> - any other key not starting with a '$' will be treated as a JS event name, for which a handler will be attached.
                Pass a validator function or an array of such functions to it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>$eventName</code> - pseudo event name, validators for it can only be triggered via angular $scope event, described later.
                Validator functions are passed to it same as to js eventNames.
            </li>
        </ul>    
</div>
