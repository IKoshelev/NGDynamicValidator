        NGDynamicValidtor is applied to a directive like this.
        <br />
        <code>
            &lt;input ng-model="name" ng-dynamic-validator="options" /&gt;
        </code>
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Options object can be defined in you controller and passed via scope,
        or you can create a json object string inline in HTML as value ot the ng-dynamic-validator attribute.
        If you choose the inline path - your string will be parsed via <code>$parse</code> Angular service
        against the $scope of the directive and <code>validators</code> service, allowing you to reference
        properties from both of them (<code>validators</code> service contains standard validtor function 
        like <code>maxLength</code> and <code>required</code>, it is described later). This example demostrates both approaches.
</p>
    <p>
        Keys on the options object are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>_validateRequestGroups</code> - array of strings. Used to specificaly target VALIDATION_REQUEST angular events
                at a certain groups of inputs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>_validateTogetherGroups</code> - array of strings. Elements that belong to a group
                will trigger validation of that group when they validate - every input in the group will also validate
                (events being validated are the same that triggered validation on the original input).
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>_validateTogetherGroupsBehaviour</code> - string describing desired behaviour. This applies when a 
                VALIDATION_REQUEST is passing through the scopes of you form, causing each input to validate and trigger
                group validation (i.e. group validation will be triggered by every input in the group). Read detailed example
                below for more info.
                To avoid misspells, there is an injectable angular constant
                <pre><code>
NGDynamicValdiatorModule.constant("excludedNonValidsBehaviours", {
    //triggers but does not validate with the group
    onlyTrigger: "onlyTrigger",
    //triggers once per group validation <strong>(default)</strong>
    afterFirst: "afterFirst",
    //will validate after each input in the gruop 
    afterEach: "afterEach"      
};
                </code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>_excludedNonValids</code> - string describing desired behaviour. Behaviour of the valitdors for events that resulted
                invalid during the last time they validated.
                <pre><code>
NGDynamicValdiatorModule.constant("excludedNonValidsBehaviours",{
    //Once an event like blur has resulted in invalid, 
    //it will validated on every ocasion, 
    //untill resulting valid again <strong>(default)</strong>
    validate: "validate",
    //Do nothing - if such an event is not participating 
    //in a triggered validation - it will not trigger
    doNothing: "doNothing",
    //Once invalid, the event will be set valid again on the 
    //next validation in which it does not participate
    setValid: "setValid"   
};
                </code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>eventName</code> - any other key not starting with a '$' will be treated as a JS event name, for which a handler will be attached.
                Pass a validator function or an array of such functions to it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>$eventName</code> - pseudo event name, validators for such events can only be triggered via angular $scope event, described later.
                Validator functions are passed to it same as to js eventNames.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>default</code> - you can treat this any other event name, though it does not create any event listeners of its own. Rather,
                this validators will fire whenever <code>ng-model="..."</code> decides to update the model and invokes the $parses chain (and as such,
                any manual triggering of the $setViewValue will also include it). 
                Prior to ng-model-options this was always user input. With ng-model-options it is whatever the <code>updateOn</code> is set to.
            </li>
        </ul>    
</div>
