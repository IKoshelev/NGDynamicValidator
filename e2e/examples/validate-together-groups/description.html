        ValidateTogetherGroups are quite simple - validation of one input in the group causes 
        all members to validate afterwards (the triggering input will validate again also).
    </p>
    <p>
        Events validated are the same - so, if original input validates <code>default</code>, entire group
        will validate it. If original inputs validates <code>blur</code> - entrie group will validate blur.
        Same goes for any event or pseudo-event combination.
    </p>
    <p>
        ValidateTogetherGroups has one unique behaviour - when validating as a result of a <code>default</code> event,
        group valiation will happen async. This is done to make sure, that the model has been updated by the time
        validation happens. It poses no problem with otherwise synchronous validation of this directive, because
        such valiadtion can not be triggerred by VALIDATION_REQUEST angular event, and the one triggered by such event
        can never change the viewValue and, as a result, the modelValue. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When a VALIDATION_REQUEST is passing through the scopes of you form, it causes each input to validate and trigger
        group validation (i.e. group validation will be triggered by every input in the group through whcih the request passes).
        How they react to this can be fine tunned via <code>_validateTogetherGroupsBehaviour</code> property of the options object.
        (That behavious applies to all group validations, not just from VALIDATION_REQUEST, but is most usefull with it).
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>"onlyTrigger"</code> - is for inputs that should trigger group validation, but don't participate (original
                validation from VALIDATION_REQUEST will still occur).
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>"afterFirst"</code> - the default value - input will validate once per VALIDATION_REQUEST.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>"afterEach"</code> - input will validate after each group memeber, through which the VALIDATION_REQUEST passes,
                resulting in exponential growth of the amount of validations as the group grows.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Seccond example of this section demonstrates this.
