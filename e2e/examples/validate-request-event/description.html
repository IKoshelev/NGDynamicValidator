<div>
    <p>
        You can trigger validation of different event combinations via
        <pre>
        <code>
$scope.$broadcast(eventNames.validateRequest, ["default", "blur", "$beforeSaveFinal"]);
            </code>
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        eventNames is an injectable constant to avoid misspells, but you can use a string instead.
        <pre>
        <code>
NGDynamicValdiatorModule.constant("validationEventNames", {
    validateRequest: "VALIDATE_REQUEST"
});
        </code>
        </pre>
        NGDynamicValidator listens for a $scope event named "VALIDATE_REQUEST" and triggers validation for every event name that is passed as 
        the second parameter - you can trigger the 'default' event this way, as well as any JS events or pseudo events (starting with $). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Validation triggered by such requests is synchronous:
        <pre><code>
$scope.$broadcast(eventNames.validateRequest, ["default", "blur", "$beforeSaveFinal"]);
//validation has finished by now
if ($scope.form.$invalid) {
...
}
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        An array of strings with specific validationRequestGroups can be passed as a third parameter to the $broadcast / $emit. 
        If you do - only inputs belonging to at least one of those groups will validate.  
   </p>
    <p>
        Combined validation summary for specific events will be available on the form controller as showcased by
        <pre><code>
ng-disabled="form.$invalidEventsSummary.default
            || form.$invalidEventsSummary.blur
            || form.$invalidEventsSummary.$beforeSaveDraft"  
        </code></pre>
        and on each input controller on that form, much in the same way as $error of vanilla angular. $error is also maintained. The difference between
        the two is that $error agregates validity status from $setValidity, for which NGDynamicValidator uses names of the validator functions, and 
        $invalidEventsSummary agregates this information for different event names. In both cases, one function from an array returning false invalidates
        the entire $setValidity key / event name.
   </p>
   <p>
       Do note the propagation model of angular events and make sure that the right scope receives them.
