        In case you need to create a validator function and make it available,
        to all your ng-dynamic-validator instances, you can do it via injecting
        "validatorsProvider" into your module config and adding it to its <code>validators</code>
        property.
    </p>
    <p>
        That property is what actually gets injected when you request "validators", and
        you can reuse your function in several controllers. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, when you construct the options object as a sting of inline JSON within
        ng-dynamic-validator attribute, that string will be $parsed against current scope
        AND validators service, so the functions will be available there too.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, <code>validatorsProvider.getValueFromValueProvider(provider)</code> provides
        the value getting behaviour from the previous example and you can use it for you functions
        to make them more versatile, as this example demonstrates.
